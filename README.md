> This example is not a complete or fully functional implementation of the game. Instead, it is a basic demonstration that illustrates how to integrate C&C (Crypts And Caverns) into the game world.

# crypts and caverns example

A simple game example

Requires Dojo to implement player movement

interface

```
#[starknet::interface]
trait ICryptsAndCaverns<TState> {

    fn owner_of(self: @TState, token_id: u256);

    fn get_svg(self: @TState, token_id: u256);

    fn generate_dungeon(self: @TState, token_id: u256);

    fn get_seed(self: @TState, token_id: u256);

    fn mint(ref self: TState);

}
```

### Components

- Player
- Map
  
### Systems

- Movement
  
### Split into several stages

- Parsing CC map data using Cairo, which can depend on the CC library
- Implementing new map generation based on the CC library, without using the mint form
- Allowing the player to move on the map and interact with local katana
- Implementing points of interest and teleportation points

## How to build

Omitting the installation of Rust, Cairo, and Scarb.

### build backend

1. Clone the source code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CheDAOLabs/cc-dojo-map.git
```

2. Execute the script, specifying the Dojo version:

```shell
dojoup
```

3. Start Katana:

```shell
katana --disable-fee --invoke-max-steps 4294967295
```

4. Compile the contract:

```shell
sozo build
```

5. Deploy the contract:

```shell
sozo migrate --name cc_dojo_map  
```

6. Indexer

```shell
torii --world WORLD_ADDRESS
```

7. Invoke the contract:

```shell
sozo execute CC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS test
```

### build client

1.Build the frontend:

```shell
cd client
yarn
```

2.Run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

3.Open the following link and use the 'WASD' keys to control movement:

```shell
http://localhost:5173/
```
