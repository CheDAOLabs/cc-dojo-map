## About

Abi-wan-kanabi is an UNLICENSE standalone TypeScript parser for Cairo smart contracts.
It enables on the fly typechecking and autocompletion for contract calls directly in TypeScript.
Developers can now catch typing mistakes early, prior to executing the call on-chain, and thus enhancing the overall Dapp development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Abiwan is a standalone typescript library. Its only dependence is on typescript version 4.9.5 or higher.
Also, it makes use of BigInt, so the tsconfig.json should target at least ES2020:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "ESNext"]
  }
}
```

### Cairo versions

abiwan will support multiple Cairo compiler versions, but not in parallel - different package versions will support consecutive Cairo versions.

Currently supported:

| Abi-Wan npm  | Cairo compiler |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [1.0.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abi-wan-kanabi/v/1.0.2)  | [Cairo 1](https://community.starknet.io/t/cairo-1-contract-syntax-is-evolving/94794)  |

### Build

To use abiwan, you must first generate types from your contracts' ABI json files, for example using the helper script (deprecated):

```bash
./scripts/extract_abi.sh <path>/<to>/<abi>.json <path>/<to>/<other_abi>.json ./
```

This will create a declaration file (.d.ts) for the abi.
You can then import it in any script and you are set to go:

```typescript
import abi from "./abi_demo.ts";
import { call } from "./kannabi.ts";
call(abi, "balance_of", 5n);
```

> If you think that we should be able to import types directly from the json files, we think so too!
> See this typescript [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063) and thumb it up!

### Run tests

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Generate `test/example.ts` from `test/example.json`

```bash
npm run generate -- --input test/example.json --output test/example.ts
```

Note: `test/example.json` was generated by `starknet-compile test/example.cairo test/example.json`

### Warning

Abiwan is still very young and has not yet been subject to an official release. We do not recommend using it in production yet.

##  Supported Cairo Types

Abi-wan-kanabi supports all of Cairo 1 types, here's the mapping between Cairo types and Typescript types

### Primitive Types

| Cairo              | TypeScript                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `felt252`          | `string \| number \| bigint`   |
| `u8 - u32`         | `number \| bigint`             |
| `u64 - u256`       | `number \| bigint \| Uint256`  |
| `ContractAddress`  | `string`                       |
| `bool`             | `boolean`                      |
| `()`               | `void`                         |

###  Complex Types

| Cairo                     | TypeScript                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Option<T>`               | `T \| undefined`                                    |
| `Array<T>`                | `T[]`                                               |
| `tuple (T1, T2, ..., Tn)` | `[T1, T2, ..., Tn]`                                 |
| `struct`                  | an object where keys are struct member names        |
| `enum`                    | a union of objects, each enum variant is an object  |

#### Struct example

**Cairo:**

```cairo
struct TestStruct {
  int128: u128,
  felt: felt252,
  tuple: (u32, u32)
}
```

**Typescript:**

```typescript
{
  int128: number | bigint | Uint256;
  felt: string | number | bigint;
  tuple: [number | bigint, number | bigint];
}
```

#### Enum example

**Cairo:**

```cairo
enum TestEnum {
  int128: u128,
  felt: felt252,
  tuple: (u32, u32),
}
```

**Typescript:**

```typescript
{ int128: number | bigint | Uint256 } |
{ felt: string | number | bigint } |
{ tuple: [number | bigint, number | bigint]}
```
